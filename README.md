# 🧵 **Differentiable Garment Pose**  
**Garment Pose Estimation with Differentiable Rendering**

---

## 🚀 **Overview**
**Differentiable Garment Pose** is an advanced framework for estimating garment poses by leveraging the power of differentiable rendering. This project combines computer vision, graphics, and machine learning to create a pipeline capable of understanding and predicting garment deformations in 3D.


In progress features:
- use a config file to set up the model
- currently only works for a single set of garment and pose. provide potential support for multiple garments and poses
- fix the hyperparameter optimization script
---

## **Key Features**
- **Differentiable Rendering:** Smooth and continuous optimization of garment poses using rendering gradients.
- **Modular Design:** Easily integrate and customize for various garment types and pose scenarios.
- **GPU accelerated**
